# tree-hanger

A rust binary for computing M edge graphs which obtain the largest number of spanning trees possible for an M edge graph.

Currently Implemented
- Kirchhoff's Theorem
- Brute force with a nice heuristic, reducing the computational cost considerably

Possible Future Work
- Tricks using eigenvalue stability
- Possible reduction via edge contraction
